# Memoria RFC / Roadmap Notes

This document tracks planned or exploratory capabilities that are not guaranteed to be implemented yet.

## Candidate Directions

1. Context condensation/checkpoint recovery orchestration in core CLI
2. Native semantic retrieval workflows (beyond MCP bridge)
3. Richer schema migration/versioning strategy
4. Client-specific MCP adapters for Gemini/OpenCode auto wiring
5. Additional observability and performance profiling commands

## Status Labels

- `idea`: concept only
- `planned`: accepted direction, not yet implemented
- `in-progress`: implementation ongoing
- `done`: shipped in code and reflected in `SPEC.md`

## Current Snapshot

- Context compression in core: `idea`
- Native semantic search in core: `idea`
- OpenCode plugin in-repo: `idea`
- Expanded verify checks and schema migration helpers: `planned`

When an RFC item is implemented, update `SPEC.md` and related user docs.
